						<h1>The Ideal Conformation</h1>

						<p>In learning to evaluate conformation, you need an understanding of all the factors that should be considered when you thoroughly evaluate each individual horse. The five major criteria for judging a horse include: balance, structure and travel, muscle, quality, and breed and sex characteristics. This system was developed to logically organize all selection factors, making them not only easier to learn but easier to recall during the judging of a class.</p>

						<p>Stock type breeds usually stand about 14.2 to15.2 hands tall. Most are deep and broad chested, as indicated by depth of heart girth and wide-set forelegs that blend into a long, sloping shoulder upward and taper into the knees downward. The good saddle back is created by medium-high but sharp withers, extending well back and combining with a deep, sloping shoulder. The back is fairly short and strong, containing a strong coupling. The barrel is formed by deep, well-sprung ribs back to the hip joints and a long sloping croup with a long bottom line extending straight to the flank. </p>

						<p>The amount and kind of muscling is important. Muscling that is long, smooth, and deeply attached to the joints is desirable. From the front, the chest should show a prominent “V,” tying into the well-developed forearms that extend down to the knee. The rear quarters are broad, deep, and heavy when viewed from either the side or rear, and they are muscled so they are full through the thigh, stifle, and gaskin, extending down to the hock. The hind leg is muscled both on the inside and outside. When viewed from the rear, there is great width extending evenly from the top of the thigh to the bottom of the stifle and gaskin. </p>

						<p>The head of a stock-type horse is short and broad with wide-set eyes, large nostrils, short muzzle, firm mouth, and a well-developed, prominent jaw. The head should appear clean-cut overall.</p>
